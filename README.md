# Results

You can copy your csv results (There will be a cpuoutput.csv and a gpuoutput.csv file) into the example.xlsx, columns A and B, and the graph will update to show population per generations.
There is also an output log produced from the run that will report the results per generation and show execution time.

# Updates to come

This current version does not allow for configuration changes. It currently does 100 generations with 60 bushes(contests) per generation thus capping population to these limitations. The cost of the contests are also hardcoded.
